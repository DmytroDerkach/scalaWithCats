Cats provides transformers for many monads, each named with a T suffix:
 EitherT composes Either with other monads, OptionT composes Option, and so on.

 We can use OptionT[List, A], aliased to ListOption[A] for convenience, to trans‐ form a List[Option[A]] into a single monad.

 Each monad transformer is a data type, defined in cats.data, that allows us to wrap stacks of monads to produce new monads.

 The main concepts we have to cover to
 understand monad transformers are:
 • the available transformer classes;
 • how to build stacks of monads using transformers;
 • how to construct instances of a monad stack;
 • how to pull apart a stack to access the wrapped monads.


 • cats.data.OptionT for Option;
 • cats.data.EitherT for Either;
 • cats.data.ReaderT for Reader;
 • cats.data.WriterT for Writer;
 • cats.data.StateT for State;
 • cats.data.IdT for the Id monad.
