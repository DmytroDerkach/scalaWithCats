The cats.instances package provides default instances for a wide variety of types.
We can import these as shown in the table below.
Each import provides instances of all Cats’ type classes for a specific parameter type:



• cats.instances.int provides instances for Int
• cats.instances.string provides instances for String
• cats.instances.list provides instances for List
• cats.instances.option provides instances for Option
• cats.instances.all provides all instances that are shipped out of the box with Cats


It is simpler and faster to use the following imports:
• import cats._ imports all of Cats’ type classes in one go;
• import cats.implicits._ imports all of the standard type class in‐ stances and all of the syntax in one go.
